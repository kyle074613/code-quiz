# code-quiz

This is a simple JavaScript quiz application. It features one quiz with five questions (not very useful), but demonstrates the use of JavaScript to update the HTML of a web page in real time. Every page that comes after the introduction page is generated using JavaScript to create elements and modify the HTML of the page. The quiz scoring is based on how fast you can finish. The amount of time left on the clock is your score. Be careful, though, as getting an incorrect answer will take 15 seconds off the clock. The user can log their score once they are done to a high score page, which is stored in local storage so the scores are saved. To get rid of the high score list, the user can click the "Clear Scores" button to delete the scores from their local storage.

## Usage

There is no installation required! All you need to do is go to kyle074613.github.io/code-quiz. After you go to that page, the entire application will be available to you!
